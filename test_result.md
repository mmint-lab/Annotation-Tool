# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.py"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"
##     needs_retesting: false
##     status_history:
##         -working: true  # or false or "NA"
##         -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##         -comment: "Detailed comment about status"
##
## frontend:

##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.js"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"
##     needs_retesting: false
##     status_history:
##         -working: true  # or false or "NA"

##   run_ui: false
##
## test_plan:
##   current_focus:
##     - "Task name 1"
##     - "Task name 2"
##   stuck_tasks:
##     - "Task name with persistent issues"
##   test_all: false

##
## agent_communication:
##     -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##     -message: "Communication message between agents"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

      ✅ NEW ANALYTICS ENDPOINTS TESTING COMPLETED - Focused testing on new analytics endpoints and regression testing completed successfully:
      
      NEW ENDPOINTS VERIFIED:
      - /api/analytics/projects: ✅ PASSED - Returns array of projects with all required fields (project_name, documents_count, total_sentences, annotated_sentences, progress, annotators_count, last_activity). Authentication properly enforced. Data integrity validated.
      - /api/analytics/projects-chart: ✅ PASSED - Returns valid PNG image (26633 bytes) with stacked chart logic. Authentication required. Chart logic validated: remaining = total - annotated, never negative.
      
      REGRESSION TESTS PASSED:
      - /api/analytics/enhanced: ✅ PASSED - Still working with proper structure (per_user, sentences_left_overall, irr_pairs)
      - /api/analytics/tag-prevalence-chart: ✅ PASSED - Returns valid PNG (13540 bytes)
      - /api/analytics/valence-chart: ✅ PASSED - Returns valid PNG (20132 bytes)
      
      DATA INTEGRITY CONFIRMED:
      - Stacked chart calculations accurate: completed vs remaining sentences
      - Progress calculations correct (annotated/total)
      - No negative remaining values
      - All authentication properly enforced
      
      MINOR NOTES:
      - Authentication returns 403 instead of 401 for unauthorized requests (acceptable behavior)
      - Test data creation and cleanup working properly
      - All chart endpoints return proper content-type headers

  - agent: "testing"

      ✅ FOCUSED PROJECTS-CHART ENDPOINT RE-TESTING COMPLETED - All specific requirements from review request verified successfully:
      
      AUTHENTICATION SCENARIOS TESTED:
      1. ✅ Unauthenticated GET returns 401 (as required)
      2. ✅ Authenticated via Bearer token returns 200 image/png (26611 bytes)
      3. ✅ Authenticated via token query param (?token=...) returns 200 image/png (26611 bytes)
      4. ✅ Data integrity verified: all projects have non-negative remaining sentences (total >= annotated)
      5. ✅ /api/analytics/projects smoke check passed with all required fields
      
      TECHNICAL FIXES APPLIED:
      - Fixed query parameter authentication by implementing optional authentication dependency
      - Updated endpoint to properly handle both Bearer token and query parameter authentication
      - Verified PNG image generation with proper content-type headers
      - Confirmed stacked chart logic: remaining = max(total - annotated, 0)
      
      SAMPLE DATA VERIFIED:
      - Project "Unassigned": total=28, annotated=6, remaining=22 (non-negative ✓)
      - Chart generates 26611-byte PNG images consistently

    message: |
      ❌ CRITICAL UI ISSUES IDENTIFIED - Comprehensive testing reveals major frontend problems preventing access to admin features:
      
      AUTHENTICATION STATUS:
      - ✅ Admin user successfully authenticated (Admin User visible in header)
      - ✅ Admin badge and privileges confirmed
      - ✅ Navigation to dashboard working
      - ✅ REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL properly configured
      
      CRITICAL ISSUE 1 - ADMIN TAB MISSING:
      - ❌ Admin tab is NOT visible in the tab navigation despite admin privileges
      - ✅ Tab container found with Documents, Annotate, Resources tabs
      - ❌ Projects Overview section cannot be accessed due to missing Admin tab
      - ❌ This prevents testing of chart naturalWidth and table headers
      
      CRITICAL ISSUE 2 - ADMIN FEATURES NOT VISIBLE:
      - ✅ Documents tab accessible with 4 documents visible
      - ❌ Manage Annotations buttons NOT visible in document cards
      - ❌ CSV download buttons NOT visible for admin users
      - ❌ Delete document buttons NOT visible
      - ❌ This prevents testing of Subject filter in Manage Annotations modal
      
      ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS:
      - Backend endpoints are working correctly (confirmed in previous tests)
      - Frontend authentication is working (admin user detected)
      - Issue appears to be in frontend conditional rendering of admin UI elements
      - Admin-specific components may not be properly checking user role or rendering
      
      IMPACT:
      - Cannot test Projects Overview analytics (chart + table)
      - Cannot test Manage Annotations modal Subject filter
      - Admin functionality is completely inaccessible via UI
      
      RECOMMENDATION:
      - Main agent needs to investigate frontend admin UI rendering logic
      - Check user role conditions in App.js for admin tab and admin buttons
      - Verify that user.role === 'admin' conditions are working properly
  - agent: "testing"
    message: |

      ✅ ADMIN ROLE-BASED ENDPOINTS IMPLEMENTATION & TESTING COMPLETED - Successfully implemented and tested all admin endpoints requested in review:
      
      ADMIN USER MANAGEMENT ENDPOINTS:
      - ✅ GET /api/admin/users: Returns all users (id, email, full_name, role, is_active) without password hashes
      - ✅ POST /api/admin/users: Creates new users with role (annotator/admin), requires email, password, full_name
      - ✅ PUT /api/admin/users/{user_id}: Updates is_active and/or role fields
      - ✅ DELETE /api/admin/users/{user_id}: Deletes user with self-delete prevention
      - ✅ POST /api/admin/users/bulk-delete: Deletes multiple users by IDs while skipping current admin
      
      ADMIN DOCUMENT MANAGEMENT ENDPOINTS:
      - ✅ POST /api/admin/documents/bulk-delete: Deletes multiple documents and cascades to sentences/annotations
      
      RBAC CONSTRAINTS VERIFIED:
      - ✅ All endpoints require role === 'admin' (return 403 for non-admin users)
      - ✅ User schema consistent with /api/auth/me (id, email, full_name, role)
      - ✅ Password hashes never exposed in responses
      - ✅ Self-delete prevention implemented for DELETE /api/admin/users/{user_id}
      - ✅ Current admin skipped in bulk delete operations
      
      COMPREHENSIVE TESTING RESULTS:
      - 31/32 backend tests passed (1 unrelated tag-prevalence endpoint 404)
      - 7/7 focused admin endpoint tests passed
      - All RBAC enforcement verified
      - Proper error handling and response formats confirmed
      - Cascading deletions working correctly (documents → sentences → annotations)
      
      IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE: All requested admin endpoints are fully functional and production-ready.
