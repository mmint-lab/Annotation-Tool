# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"

##     -message: "Communication message between agents"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

Tested 5 documents with different annotation scenarios: 1) Documents with tagged annotations show tags correctly, 2) Documents with only skipped annotations show no tags (correct behavior - skipped annotations are excluded by design), 3) Documents with no annotations show plain text. The format_sentence_tags function correctly excludes skipped annotations (line 881-882 in server.py). User reports of missing tags likely due to testing with documents containing only skipped annotations, which is expected behavior."

FINDINGS: 1) Admin login successful (admin@sdoh.com / admin123) ✓, 2) Found test_discharge_summaries.csv document with 17 sentences and 10 annotations (7 tagged, 3 skipped) ✓, 3) Existing tagged annotations have proper structure with domains, categories, tags, and valence ✓, 4) Admin paragraph export (/api/admin/download/annotated-paragraphs/{document_id}) shows tags correctly formatted as '[Tags: Domain:Category:Tag(+/-)@UserName]' ✓, 5) Created fresh annotation with 2 tags (Economic Stability:Employment:Unemployed(-) and Social and Community Context:Social Cohesion:Social Isolation(-)) ✓, 6) Fresh annotation immediately appeared in paragraph export with correct formatting ✓, 7) User-specific export (/api/download/my-annotated-paragraphs/{document_id}) also working correctly ✓. CONCLUSION: Paragraph export functionality is working as designed. Tags appear correctly in annotated_paragraph_text column. The format_sentence_tags function properly excludes skipped annotations (by design). User issue likely due to testing with documents containing only skipped annotations, which is expected behavior since skipped annotations are intentionally excluded from paragraph reconstruction."

      LATEST UPDATE (P0 Fix): Updated per-user CSV and paragraph export endpoints to include:
      
      1. CSV Export (/api/download/my-annotations-csv/{document_id}):
         - Added 'timestamp' column (annotation created_at)
         - Confidence is now extracted from per-tag data (not annotation level)
         - is_skipped column properly shows TRUE for skipped annotations
         - Column order: document_id, sentence_id, subject_id, row_index, sentence_index, sentence_text, tag_domain, tag_category, tag, valence, confidence, notes, is_skipped, timestamp, duration_ms
      
      2. Paragraph Export (/api/download/my-annotated-paragraphs/{document_id}):
         - Tags now include timestamp: [Tags: Domain:Category:Tag(valence,conf=X)@User@Timestamp]
         - Skipped annotations now appear as [SKIPPED@User@Timestamp] instead of being hidden
         - Per-tag confidence included in tag format
      
      3. Frontend Changes:
         - Added completion indicator (green "Complete" badge) in annotation interface when all sentences annotated
         - Progress bar now shows "Annotated: X/Y" count instead of just viewing position
         - Removed deprecated project_name badge from document cards in Documents tab
      
      Please test:
      1. Backend: Both CSV export endpoints with documents containing tagged AND skipped annotations
      2. Frontend: Annotation interface completion indicator (need document with ALL sentences annotated)
      3. Frontend: Documents tab should NOT show project name badges on document cards

      ❌ CLEAR ALL ANNOTATIONS BUTTON TESTING COMPLETED - CRITICAL ISSUE FOUND
      
      TESTING SUMMARY:
      - ❌ Clear All Annotations button is NOT VISIBLE in the annotation interface
      - ✅ Admin login successful (admin@sdoh.com / admin123)
      - ✅ Annotate tab accessible and functional
      - ✅ Document annotation interface loads correctly (ten_item_test.csv)
      - ✅ Existing annotations present (124/134 annotations, skipped annotation visible)
      - ✅ Scrolled to bottom of annotation interface successfully
      - ❌ Clear All Annotations button NOT FOUND despite code implementation
      
      CRITICAL ISSUE DETAILS:
      The Clear All Annotations button is implemented in the code (StructuredAnnotationInterface component, lines 939-957) but is NOT rendering in the UI. The button should appear at the bottom of the annotation interface but is completely missing from the DOM.
      
      CODE ANALYSIS:
      - Button implementation exists with proper confirmation dialog
      - Uses onClearAllAnnotations prop function
      - Should be visible when annotations are present
      - Proper disabled state logic implemented
      
      IMPACT:
      Users cannot clear all annotations as requested in the review. This is a blocking issue that prevents the core functionality from being accessible to users.
      
      RECOMMENDATION:
      Main agent needs to investigate why the Clear All Annotations button is not rendering in the UI despite being implemented in the code. Possible issues:
      1. Missing prop passing (onClearAllAnnotations function)
      2. Conditional rendering logic preventing button display
      3. CSS/styling issues hiding the button
      4. Component structure issues
      
      The button implementation appears correct but is not visible to users, making this feature non-functional.

      ✅ NEW ANALYTICS ENDPOINTS TESTING COMPLETED - Focused testing on new analytics endpoints and regression testing completed successfully:
      
      NEW ENDPOINTS VERIFIED:
      - /api/analytics/projects: ✅ PASSED - Returns array of projects with all required fields (project_name, documents_count, total_sentences, annotated_sentences, progress, annotators_count, last_activity). Authentication properly enforced. Data integrity validated.
      - /api/analytics/projects-chart: ✅ PASSED - Returns valid PNG image (26633 bytes) with stacked chart logic. Authentication required. Chart logic validated: remaining = total - annotated, never negative.
      
      REGRESSION TESTS PASSED:
      - /api/analytics/enhanced: ✅ PASSED - Still working with proper structure (per_user, sentences_left_overall, irr_pairs)
      - /api/analytics/tag-prevalence-chart: ✅ PASSED - Returns valid PNG (13540 bytes)
      - /api/analytics/valence-chart: ✅ PASSED - Returns valid PNG (20132 bytes)

      4. ✅ Data integrity verified: all projects have non-negative remaining sentences (total >= annotated)
      5. ✅ /api/analytics/projects smoke check passed with all required fields
      
      TECHNICAL FIXES APPLIED:
      - Fixed query parameter authentication by implementing optional authentication dependency
      - Updated endpoint to properly handle both Bearer token and query parameter authentication
      - Verified PNG image generation with proper content-type headers
      - Confirmed stacked chart logic: remaining = max(total - annotated, 0)
      
      SAMPLE DATA VERIFIED:
      - Project "Unassigned": total=28, annotated=6, remaining=22 (non-negative ✓)
      - Chart generates 26611-byte PNG images consistently
      - All required JSON fields present: project_name, documents_count, total_sentences, annotated_sentences, progress, annotators_count, last_activity

      ❌ CRITICAL UI ISSUES IDENTIFIED - Comprehensive testing reveals major frontend problems preventing access to admin features:
      
      AUTHENTICATION STATUS:
      - ✅ Admin user successfully authenticated (Admin User visible in header)
      - ✅ Admin badge and privileges confirmed
      - ✅ Navigation to dashboard working
      - ✅ REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL properly configured
      
      CRITICAL ISSUE 1 - ADMIN TAB MISSING:
      - ❌ Admin tab is NOT visible in the tab navigation despite admin privileges
      - ✅ Tab container found with Documents, Annotate, Resources tabs
      - ❌ Projects Overview section cannot be accessed due to missing Admin tab
      - ❌ This prevents testing of chart naturalWidth and table headers
      
      CRITICAL ISSUE 2 - ADMIN FEATURES NOT VISIBLE:
      - ✅ Documents tab accessible with 4 documents visible
      - ❌ Manage Annotations buttons NOT visible in document cards
      - ❌ CSV download buttons NOT visible for admin users
      - ❌ Delete document buttons NOT visible
      - ❌ This prevents testing of Subject filter in Manage Annotations modal
      
      ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS:
      - Backend endpoints are working correctly (confirmed in previous tests)
      - Frontend authentication is working (admin user detected)
      - Issue appears to be in frontend conditional rendering of admin UI elements
      - Admin-specific components may not be properly checking user role or rendering
      
      IMPACT:
      - Cannot test Projects Overview analytics (chart + table)
      - Cannot test Manage Annotations modal Subject filter
      - Admin functionality is completely inaccessible via UI
      
      RECOMMENDATION:
      - Main agent needs to investigate frontend admin UI rendering logic
      - Check user role conditions in App.js for admin tab and admin buttons
      - Verify that user.role === 'admin' conditions are working properly

      IMPLEMENTATION: Per-User Annotation Export Feature
      
      Added three new backend endpoints:
      1. /api/download/my-annotations-csv/{document_id} - Annotators can download their own annotations in inline CSV format
      2. /api/download/my-annotated-paragraphs/{document_id} - Annotators can download their own annotations as reconstructed paragraphs
      3. Updated /api/admin/download/annotated-csv-inline/{document_id} - Now includes confidence and duration_ms columns
      
      Frontend Updates:
      1. Added "My CSV" and "My Paragraphs" download buttons in the annotation interface header (StructuredAnnotationInterface component)
      2. Added "Download for selected user" button in Manage Annotations modal that uses admin endpoint with user_id filter (only enabled when a specific user is selected)
      
      All new endpoints support proper authentication and follow the same patterns as existing download endpoints.
      
      TESTING INSTRUCTIONS:
      Backend testing should verify:
      - /api/download/my-annotations-csv/{document_id} returns CSV with current user's annotations only
      - /api/download/my-annotated-paragraphs/{document_id} returns paragraphs with current user's tags only
      - Admin CSV export includes confidence and duration_ms columns
      - Proper authentication enforcement on all endpoints
      
      Frontend testing should verify:
      - Download buttons appear in annotation interface header
      - Buttons trigger correct downloads with proper filenames
      - Admin's "Download for selected user" button in Manage Annotations modal works correctly
      - Button is disabled when "All" annotators is selected
      
      Please test all new backend endpoints first, then proceed with frontend testing.

      2. ✅ Found test_discharge_summaries.csv document (ID: 155984e7-57b6-4dd6-b3e1-93632ba41fc4)
      3. ✅ Document has 17 sentences with 10 annotations (7 tagged, 3 skipped)
      4. ✅ Tagged annotations have proper structure: domain, category, tag, valence
      5. ✅ Admin paragraph export shows tags correctly formatted as [Tags: Domain:Category:Tag(+/-)@UserName]
      6. ✅ Created fresh annotation with 2 tags and verified immediate appearance in export
      7. ✅ User-specific export endpoint also working correctly
      
      ACTUAL CSV CONTENT VERIFIED:
      - Tags appear in annotated_paragraph_text column as designed
      - Format: "Patient is a 45-year-old male... [Tags: Economic Stability:Employment:Unemployed(-)@Test User, Social and Community Context:Social Cohesion:Social Isolation(-)@SDOH Administrator]"
      - Multiple tags per sentence properly comma-separated
      - User attribution correctly included (@UserName)
